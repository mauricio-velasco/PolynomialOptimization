# PolynomialOptimization

# A package for solving multivariate Sum-of-Squares optimization problems.

### A Sum-of-squares optimization problem is an optimization problem of the form
$\min c_1y_1+\dots c_qy_q \text{ where $y$ ranges over the values in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that the polynomials $g_i$ below are sums of squares}$
 $g_1 = y_1p_1(x)+\dots y_qp_q(x) + p_0(x)$
